In so doing, MAGIC will facilitate detecting cyber attacks on DER in their earliest stages and ameliorating the effect of attacks immediately.\nObjectives Develop secure AI/ML algorithms to detect cyber attacks on aggregations of DER and distinguish attacks from normal operating conditions. Extend a reinforcement learning framework developed in previous RMT/CEDS projects to mitigate the effect of cyber attacks on DER in a wide array of operating conditions. Integrate the attack detection and mitigation algorithms into a commercially available substation/microgrid management platform for algorithm demonstration. Create an open source simulation tool allowing electric utilities to determine rules to detect and mitigate cyber attacks designed to severely disrupt normal grid operations or cause voltage instabilities. Develop a software test harness to assess the security of AI/ML algorithms for electric grid attack detection and mitigation. Project Description The Supervisory Parameter Adjustment for Distribution Energy Storage (SPADES) project will develop the methodology and tools allowing Energy Storage Systems (ESS) to automatically reconfigure themselves to counteract cyberattacks against both the ESS control system directly and indirectly through the electric distribution grid. This research will begin with an effort to analyze the stability of both ESS control systems and the interaction of the ESS control system and the electric grid, to determine what parameters an attacker would change if a given device (or multiple devices) were to be compromised. Then, the research team will develop a supervisory control framework that utilizes adaptive control and reinforcement learning techniques to adjust ESS control system parameters and ESS active and reactive power injections to actively defend against a variety of cyberattacks. The supervisory control framework will be validated in Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) experiments where an independent red team will attempt to alter control parameters of an ESS to prevent the device from providing grid services. The reinforcement learning defensive algorithms will be integrated into the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA) Open Modeling Framework (OMF), thereby allowing defensive strategies to be tailored on a utility specific basis. The major outcomes of this project will be the tools to isolate the component of the ESS control system that has been compromised during a cyberattack as well as policies for changing the control parameters of ESS to mitigate a wide variety of cyberattacks on both the ESS device itself and the electric distribution grid.\nThis project is supported by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response (CESER) Risk Management Tools and Technologies (RMT) Program.\nPrincipal Investigator: Daniel Arnold (PI; LBNL)\nSenior Personnel: Sean Peisert (LBNL) Ryan King (NREL) Lisa Slaughter (NRECA) Anna Scaglione (Cornell Tech) Bruno Leao (Siemens)\nPress regarding this project: DOE Press Release: “DOE Announces $39 Million in Research Funding to Enhance Cybersecurity of Clean Distributed Energy Resources” - Sept. 12, 2023\nBerkeley Lab leading the way with new cybersecurity projects - Nov. 6, 2023\nMore information is available on other Berkeley Lab R\u0026amp;D projects focusing on cybersecurity in general, as well as specifically on cybersecurity for energy delivery systems.\n","date":1708992000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1708992000,"objectID":"095cb5092c40023fa03280c0c560cecc","permalink":"https://secpriv.lbl.gov/project/rmt-magic/","publishdate":"2024-02-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/rmt-magic/","section":"project","summary":"Project MAGIC will develop artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to detect and mitigate cyber attacks on aggregations of Distributed Energy Resources (DER).

These applications include the following.\nHigh Performance Computing This project is developing new architectures appropriate to the performance and usage needs of scientific computing to secure scientific data from the edge to the HPC center. Scientific data today is at risk due to how it is collected, stored, and analyzed in highly disparate computing systems. We believe that in order to solve the problems described above that future HPC hardware and software solutions should be co-designed together with security and scientific computing integrity concepts designed and built into as much of the stack from the outset as possible.\nEdge Computing This project is developing new architectures appropriate to the performance and usage needs of scientific computing to secure scientific data from the edge to the HPC center. This includes includes sensor and edge systems that collect and process of that data takes place outside protection boundaries of traditional HPC centers, including against attacks such as ransomware and physical attacks against the computing system. Our approach will address the gaps left by existing solutions for scientific workflows to address the specific power, performance, and usability, and needs from the edge to the HPC center.\nThe secure HPC and Edge computing projects are supported by the US Department of Energy’s Office of Science’s Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) program under the following grants:\n“Toward a Hardware/Software Co-Design Framework for Ensuring the Integrity of Exascale Scientific Data,” PI: Sean Peisert, 2015.\n“Cybersecurity for Edge-to-Center Scientific Computing in Advanced Wireless Environments,” PI: Sean Peisert, Co-PIs: Venkatesh Akella and Jason Lowe-Power, 2021.\nNuclear Treaty Verification It is essential to have the ability to ensure that software operating on arms control monitoring equipment has not undergone modification and associated data has not been disclosed. It has been many years since most treaties and other agreements were implemented. Existing approaches to ensuring data confidentiality, and software and data integrity, are outdated and thus are easily defeated by a motivated adversary.

As these devices begin to provide grid services, it is critical to ensure that they are resistant to cyber attacks and cannot be exploited as a mechanism to disrupt the operation of the power grid. Tools from nonlinear and optimal control theory can be utilized to develop control policies to re-dispatch setpoints in both the ESS and the surrounding electric grid infrastructure to mitigate the effect of cyber attacks.\nObjectives Characterize the interaction ESS control systems and Distributed Energy Resource (DER) smart inverter functions on electric grid voltage stability.\nDevelop a supervisory control system (reinforcement learning-based) that will identify and autonomously update control parameters of the power electronic control systems within ESS devices.\nValidate control approaches via Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) testing at the LBNL FLEXGRID facility.\nIntegrate the defensive reinforcement learning-based agent into the NRECA Open Modeling Framework (OMF) simulation tool.\nProject Description The Supervisory Parameter Adjustment for Distribution Energy Storage (SPADES) project will develop the methodology and tools allowing Energy Storage Systems (ESS) to automatically reconfigure themselves to counteract cyberattacks against both the ESS control system directly and indirectly through the electric distribution grid. This research will begin with an effort to analyze the stability of both ESS control systems and the interaction of the ESS control system and the electric grid, to determine what parameters an attacker would change if a given device (or multiple devices) were to be compromised. Then, the research team will develop a supervisory control framework that utilizes adaptive control and reinforcement learning techniques to adjust ESS control system parameters and ESS active and reactive power injections to actively defend against a variety of cyberattacks. The supervisory control framework will be validated in Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) experiments where an independent red team will attempt to alter control parameters of an ESS to prevent the device from providing grid services. The reinforcement learning defensive algorithms will be integrated into the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA) Open Modeling Framework (OMF), thereby allowing defensive strategies to be tailored on a utility specific basis. The major outcomes of this project will be the tools to isolate the component of the ESS control system that has been compromised during a cyberattack as well as policies for changing the control parameters of ESS to mitigate a wide variety of cyberattacks on both the ESS device itself and the electric distribution grid.\nThis project is supported by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Cybersecurity for Energy Delivery Systems (CEDS) program.\nPrincipal Investigator: Daniel Arnold (PI; LBNL)\nSenior Personnel: Sean Peisert (LBNL) Ciaran Roberts (LBNL) Sy-Toan Ngo (LBNL) David Pinney (NRECA) Anna Scaglione (Cornell Tech) Bruno Leao (Siemens)\nPartners: Cornell Tech\nNational Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA)\nSiemens\nProject Workshops and Reports Year 1, held on 12/02/2021 Year 2, held on 12/08/2022 and 12/15/2022 Years 3 and 4\nPress regarding this project: TBD\nPublications resulting from this project: Wu, T., Scaglione, A., and Arnold, D. “Complex-Value Spatio-temporal Graph Convolutional Neural Networks and its Applications to Electric Power Systems AI,” IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid, early access, https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2023.3332591\nWu, T., Scaglione, A., and Arnold, D., “Constrained Reinforcement Learning for Predictive Control in Real-Time Stochastic Dynamic Optimal Power Flow,” in IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2023.3326121\nLeao, B.

This includes strategies to ensure the safety of the electric grid from cyber attacks. Aggregations of DER constitute a mechanism through which hostile entities can remotely influence multiple systems and states in the grid in such a way that distribution system operators have virtually no warning of an attack and no clear strategy to mitigate the effects of intrusion. Furthermore, as infrastructure already exists to reconfigure DER smart inverter settings, attackers need not infiltrate individual systems to gain control over large quantities of DER. Instead, attackers need only gain access to one of a handful of systems designed to wirelessly update DER.\nObjectives Development of a state observer that detects the presence and severity of cyber attacks. Creation of a set of adaptive controllers that adjust settings of DER inverter controllers and distribution grid voltage regulation and protection systems to mitigate the cyber-physical attack in real time. Development of reinforcement learning-based agents that will explore defenses against different attack scenarios Project Description The LBNL-led “Cybersecurity via Inverter-Grid Automatic Reconfiguration (CIGAR)” project seeks to develop supervisory control algorithms to counteract cyber-physical attacks that have compromised multiple independent systems in the electric grid. This research will begin with an effort to analyze the stability of different types of feedback control systems (e.g, distributed energy resources, and voltage regulation and protection systems) in the electric grid to determine what parameters an attacker would change if DER and utility voltage regulation and protection systems were compromised. Then, the research team will develop adaptive control algorithms that adjust critical parameters in non-compromised systems to actively fight the cyber-physical attack.

We have defined a Medical Science DMZ as a method or approach that allows data flows at scale while simultaneously addressing the HIPAA Security Rule and related regulations governing biomedical data and appropriately managing risk. We emphasize use cases that involve scientists transferring and processing medical research data that have very different requirements than those of medical centers communicating with suppliers, service providers, and employees.

Today, DDoS mitigation across DOE Sites is largely handled at the site borders using a combination of heuristic and filtering techniques, manual changes, and commercial services that can “absorb” attacks against specific sites. With the scale of DDoS increasing dramatically with little indication of slowing down, the task of DDoS detection and mitigation across ESnet’s extensive wide area network (WAN) becomes a higher priority, with increased complexity of detection and execution.\nAs ESnet pushes the boundary of modern network technology, we must also develop the security tools and strategies that are most effective for monitoring the WAN to prevent DDoS attacks for a next-generation network architecture. Specifically, this includes research issues of disambiguating very large science flows from malicious attacks, and developing mechanisms and tools for DDoS detection that can integrate this knowledge.\nWhile commercial DDoS tools and services exist to mitigate DDoS attacks to certain extents, and within typical enterprise and service provider networks, the effectiveness of those tools is extremely limited. ESnet transits all types of traffic, from ordinary websites and email to massive scientific data sets, thus DDoS protection targeting multiple facets of the network stack is required. Since commercial tools are typically and almost exclusively focused on commercial enterprise traffic, research on both detecting and mitigating DDoS is still deemed as essential as demonstrated by the interest of numerous other organizations funding research efforts in this space, including NSF, DARPA’s “Extreme DDoS Defense (XD3),” and others. However, most research [BBHkc09,MR04] and commercial service products target protection for individual sites, not entire WANs, let alone WANs carrying large volumes of scientific traffic. Since it is ESnet’s responsibility to protect availability for the entire ESnet WAN, this raises both the importance and value of blocking attacks earlier, before they reach individual DOE Sites.\nA focus in the DOE space is ESnet’s ability to inform DDoS identification techniques with additional information sources to reduce the likelihood of false positives. WAN level detection algorithms can be bolstered by information provided by DDoS detection information provided by the Sites to confirm positive DDoS detection. On the opposite front, pre-defined network circuit reservations (as are available through OSCARS) can help identify a large flow as being scientific data rather than a malicious attack. The DOE is in a unique position to perform the research necessary to take a very different approach from both commercial services as well as the research approaches pursued by funding agencies other than DOE.\nThis project is supported by the US Department of Energy’s iJC3 Cyber research program\nDDoS Detection Source Code at GitHub\nPublications resulting from this project: Chang Liu, “Network Monitoring and Security Enhancement in Software-Defined Networking,” Ph.D Dissertation, University of California, Davis, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, May 2019.

How can we make claims about the integrity of data as it traverses open, international networks and via instruments and systems with widely varying reliability and provenance? Numerous causes for integrity loss are possible, including bugs in existing computational pipelines, network events, user error, unintentional system effects or even intentional attack by outsiders (e.g., scientific competitors), insiders (e.g., disgruntled employees), or in the hardware/software supply chain, without any trace of the modification. Given these gaps and shortcomings in existing HPC solutions, how can we make claims about the integrity of the scientific data as it traverses those systems and networks?\nWe believe that in order to solve the problems described above that future HPC hardware and software solutions should be co-designed together with security and scientific computing integrity concepts designed and built into as much of the stack from the outset as possible. Given the risk of data loss due to software and hardware, this should take into account hardware elements, operating systems, compilers, application software, and the networking stack, all the way down to the way in which software developers write software and users interact with systems in a way that can affect scientific computing integrity. However, prior to laying out the research roadmap to design and construct such an architecture, we believe that several important aspects first need to be understood more clearly.\nThis project takes a broad look at several aspects of security and scientific integrity issues in HPC systems. Using several case studies as exemplars, and working closely with both domain scientists as well as facility staff, we propose to test and validate several initial concepts in existing scientific computing workflows at NERSC DOE HPC facility, and analyze those models better characterize integrity-related computational behavior.\nEarly work on this project focused on a range of activities, including identifying misuse of computing systens, leveraging blockchains for scientific computing. More recent work has focused on developing trustworthy scientific computing architectures.\nFor more on the current work, see Data Enclaves for Scientific Computing.\nThis project is supported by the US Department of Energy’s Office of Science’s Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) program.\nPress regarding this project: Berkeley Lab Cybersecurity Specialist Highlights Data Sharing Benefits, Challenges at NAS Meeting — Dec. 4, 2018\nCRD’s Peisert to Discuss Data Sharing at National Academies’ COSEMPUP Meeting — Nov. 5, 2018\nLab Experts Help Coordinate ISC18, World’s First, Largest Computing Conference - June 21, 2018\nInto the Medical Science DMZ (Science Node) March 23, 2018\nBerkeley Lab Researchers Contribute to Making Blockchains Even More Robust — January 30, 2018\nESnet’s Science DMZ Design Could Help Transfer, Protect Medical Research Data (Science Node) — October 16, 2017\nBerkeley Lab’s cybersecurity expert Sean Peisert discusses challenges \u0026amp; opportunities of securing HPC — Aug. 24, 2017\nHPC security article in Communications of the ACM\nVideo accompanying HPC security article on Vimeo\nPublications resulting from this project: Ayaz Akram, Venkatesh Akella, Sean Peisert, and Jason Lowe-Power, “Enabling Design Space Exploration for RISC-V Secure Compute Environments,” Proceedings of the Fifth Workshop on Computer Architecture Research with RISC-V (CARRV), (co-located with ISCA 2021) June 17, 2021\nSean Peisert, “Trustworthy Scientific Computing,” Communications of the ACM (CACM), 64(5), pp. 18–21, May 2021.\nAyaz Akram, Anna Giannakou, Venkatesh Akella, Jason Lowe-Power, and Sean Peisert, “Performance Analysis of Scientific Computing Workloads on General Purpose TEEs,” Proceedings of the 35th IEEE International Parallel \u0026amp; Distributed Processing Sysmposium (IPDPS), May 17–21, 2021.\nAyaz Akram, “Trusted Execution for High-Performance Computing,” Proceedings of the 15th EuroSys Doctoral Workshop (EuroDW), 2021. video\nAyaz Akram, “Architectures for Secure High-Performance Computing,” Proceedings of the Young Architect Workshop (YArch) held in conjunction with the International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems (ASPLOS), April 2021. video\nAyaz Akram, Anna Giannakou, Venkatesh Akella, Jason Lowe-Power, and Sean Peisert, …","date":1473897600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1473897600,"objectID":"4f12508634d6b755a4a3a74ba7c26020","permalink":"https://secpriv.lbl.gov/project/ascr-hpc-cybersecurity-codesign/","publishdate":"2016-09-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/ascr-hpc-cybersecurity-codesign/","section":"project","summary":"This project takes a broad look at several aspects of security and scientific integrity issues in HPC systems.

Modern science is increasingly data-driven and collaborative in nature, producing petabytes of data that can be shared by tens to thousands of scientists all over the world. The NSF-supported International Research Network Connection (IRNC) links have been essential to performing these science experiments.\nProviding near real-time monitoring and visualization of international data transfers will help ensure that scientific workflows are operating at maximum efficiency. NetSage services provide an unprecedented combination of passive measurements, including SNMP data, flow data, and Zeek/Bro-based traffic analysis, as well as active measurements, mainly perfSONAR, and longitudinal network performance data visualization. User privacy is a significant concern in this project given the data flowing through the exchange points. NetSage addresses these concerns through the use of a privacy advisory board that will ensure the data gathering activities are conducted to meet all community standards. The proposed work is a partnership between Indiana University, University of California at Davis, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and University of Hawaii at Manoa. This uniquely strong team combines backgrounds in production international network support, networking measurement and prediction tools, network-intensive applications and data visualization.\nThis project is supported by the National Science Foundation’s International Research Network Connections (IRNC) program.\nRead more and demo the interface at the project web site.\nNetflow Analysis and Prediction Source Code at GitHub\nPublications resulting from this project: Anna Giannakou, Dipankar Dwivedi, and Sean Peisert, “A Machine Learning Approach for Packet Loss Prediction in Science Flows,” Future Generation Computer Systems - Special Issue on Innovating the Network for Data Intensive Science - INDIS 2018, accepted 25 July, 2019.\nAlberto Gonzalez, Jason Leigh, Sean Peisert, Brian Tierney, Andrew Lee, Jennifer M.

However, a number of features of the power system make it particularly vulnerable to cyber attacks via IP networks. “IT security” approaches to dealing with malware and other cyber attacks via a network include traditional intrusion detection systems, firewalls, encryption, etc… These techniques can help, but as we’ve observed in a previous project, traditional IT security techniques tend to leave a gap in safety and protection when applied to cyber-physical devices because they do not consider physical information known about the cyber-physical device they are protecting. Not only does this leave a gap in protection, but it ignores valuable information that could be used to better protect the cyber-physical device.\nThe goal of this is to design and implement a measurement network, which can detect and report the resultant impact of cyber security attacks on the distribution system network. The cyber-attacks against the distribution grid that we primarily focus on are ones that (1) modify the distribution grid operation and causing it to behave in individually or collectively disruptive or damaging ways; (2) mask communication from substation components in the distribution grid, through cyber denial-of-service attack, and prevent awareness of the actual operational function; and (3) mask communication to substation components in the distribution grid, through cyber denial of service attack, causing misbehaving components to fail to receive instructions to restore safe operation. The detection and reporting will be within short time frame, at present not communicable or measured on the distribution system, allowing operators to perform remedial action.\nTo do this, this project uses micro phasor measurement units to capture information about the physical state of the power distribution grid and combines this with SCADA command monitoring in real time. The project will build models of safe and unsafe states of the distribution grid so that certain classes cyber attacks can potentially be detected by their physical effects on the power distribution grid alone. The result will be a system that provides an independent, integrated picture of the distribution grid’s physical state, which will be difficult for a cyber-attacker to subvert using data-spoofing techniques.\nSee the detection algorithms in action via our graphical front-end at the LBNL Power Data Portal.\nSource code for the LBNL Stream-Processing Architecture for Real-time Cyber-physical Security (SPARCS) is available at GitHub.\nThis project is supported by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Cybersecurity for Energy Delivery Systems (CEDS) program.\nPrincipal Investigators: Sean Peisert (PI; LBNL)\nCiaran Roberts (Co-PI; LBNL)\nAnna Scaglione (Co-PI; ASU)\nSenior Personnel Reinhard Gentz (LBNL)\nStudents Mahdi Jamei (ASU)\nIndustry Partners: EnerNex (Erich Gunther (previously), Aaron Snyder, Bob Zavadil, Dave Mueller, Jens Schoene)\nEPRI (Galen Rasche, Jens Boemer)\nPower Standards Laboratory (Alex McEachern)\nCorelight (née Broala)\nOSIsoft (John Matranga)\nRiverside Public Utilities\nSouthern Company\nProject Alumni: Chuck McParland (Former Co-PI; LBNL → RTISYS / LBNL Affiliate)\nEmma Stewart (Former Co-PI; LBNL → LLNL)\nPress regarding this project: Electric grid protection through low-cost sensors, machine learning (Route 50; formerly Government Computing News) — September 21, 2018\nCyber Defense Tool Is an Early Warning System for Grid Attacks (IEEE Spectrum Energywise Blog) — March 27, 2018\nCombination of Old and New Yields Novel Power Grid Cybersecurity Tool — March 7 2018\nPublications resulting from this project: Mahdi Jamei, Raksha Ramakrishna, Teklemariam Tesfay, Reinhard Gentz, Ciaran Roberts, Anna Scaglione, and Sean Peisert, “Phasor Measurement Units Optimal Placement and Performance Limits for Fault Localization,” IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications (J-SAC), Special Issue on Communications and Data Analytics in Smart Grid, accepted 2 October, 2019.

The project was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Applied Mathematics Section. The overall goals of the project were to develop mathematical and statistical methods to detect intrusions of high-performance computing systems. Our mathematical analysis is predicated on the fact that large HPC systems represent unique environments, quite unlike unspecialized systems or general Internet traffic. User behavior on HPC systems tends to be much more constrained (often driven by research deadlines and limited computational resources), and is generally limited to certain paradigms of computation (the set of codes performing the bulk of execution provide a rich source of information). In addition, the collaboration networks of users on an HPC system exhibits special characteristics than can be exploited to detect misuse or fraud. In this research work, we employed real system data, which we have obtained in collaboration with staff in the NERSC Division of LBNL.\nLBNL was this lead institution for this activity, which also involved the University of California at Davis (UC Davis) and the International Computer Science Institute (ICSI) at UC Berkeley through LBNL subcontracts. Over the course of the project, LBNL senior investigators included Deb Agarwal, David H. Bailey (PI), Scott Campbell, Juan Meza, Sean Peisert, Taghrid Samak, and Alexander Slepoy. The UC Davis senior investigators were Sean Peisert (joint appointment) and Matt Bishop. ICSI senior investigators included Vern Paxson and Robin Sommer. The research team was supported in their software development and data collection techniques by the staff at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC). A variety of students and postdocs at the Berkeley Lab, UC Berkeley, and UC Davis, were also involved, as were external collaborators (not funded by this grant), at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine and the University of San Francisco.\nKey work included:\nThe adaptation and development of a “rule-ensemble” technique from the field of mathematical statistics to accurately and economically finds class labels, and to determine which parameter constraints are most useful for predicting these labels. The development and application of a technique of fingerprinting computation on HPC machines based on network theory and machine learning. An examination of Domain Name Server (DNS) traffic using entropy analysis. Development of data sanitization techniques, so that real cybersecurity data can be shared with a wider community of researchers without compromising user privacy. Development of a script to generate a set of synthetic jobs, which then can be used to test job fingerprint algorithms.

We also asked, what are the relationships between data fields that would need to be made in order to reveal certain information, what associations need to be protected in order to conceal certain information, and, finally, given policy constraints by the different stakeholders, can a dataset be sanitized in a way that satisfies the policies of all of those people, or would certain compromises to one or more policies need to be made?

This included exploration of how to compose systems from pre-analyzed process components, how to analyze the vulnerability of these systems to attacks, and how to guarantee that important security properties are ensured for the resulting composed system. The underlying processes represent aspects of national and local elections, their composition produces an election process, and analysis of the composition gives insight into potential errors or attacks on the election. Providing an approach for formally reasoning about human participation extends current security work. The project also breaks new ground by exploring process-based approaches for modeling and defending against attacks.\nAnother thrust that we have examined looked at auditing. Election auditing verifies that the systems and procedures work as intended, and that the votes have been counted correctly. If a problem arises, forensic techniques enable auditors to determine what happened and how to compensate if possible. Complicating this is that the audit trails enabling analysis of failures may contain information that either exposes the identity of the voter (enabling voter coercion, for example); or that communicates a message to a third party (enabling vote selling). The goal of this project was to determine the information needed to assess whether the election process in general, and e-voting machines in particular, operate with the desired degree of assurance, especially with respect to anonymity and privacy.\nThe leads at UC Davis for this work were:\nMatt Bishop (PI; UC Davis) Sean Peisert (CoPI; UC Davis and LBNL)\nThis work was performed in close cooperation with the Marin County Registrar of Voters’ office and the Yolo County Clerk-Recorder’s office.\nWe also collaborated closely with Lee Osterweil, Lori Clarke, George Avrunin, and their graduate students and postdocs in the LASER Lab at UMass Amherst.\nMore information is available at the UC Davis elections and electronic voting project web site and UMass Amherst elections project web site.\nSelected publications resulting from this project Matt Bishop, Philip Stark, Josh Benaloh, Joseph Kiniry, Ron Rivest, Sean Peisert, Joseph Hall, and Vanessa Teague, “Open-Source Software Won’t Ensure Election Security,” Lawfare, August 24, 2017.

Whereas security has traditionally been defined with respect to a perimeter, using static and binary access control decisions, we assert that such a perimeter no longer exists and that traditional access control techniques inhibit authorized users from performing their job. We define the “insider threat” as a combination of (a) access to a particular resource, (b) knowledge of a particular resource, and/or (c) trust of an individual by a particular organization. Moreover, the insider threat is clearly also not binary, but a spectrum of “insiderness” based on the aforementioned qualities. In the past, we have sought to develop access control solutions that integrate this understanding in combination while also being informed by social science of how users may react most optimally to system access control and countermeasures.

The original software was called “Bro” as an “Orwellian reminder that monitoring comes hand in hand with the potential for privacy violations.” Bro changed its name to Zeek and has also been commercialized in a spinoff called Corelight.\nPaxson first deployed Zeek while at the Berkeley Labin 1996, and the USENIX Security Symposium published Paxson’s original paper on Zeek in 1998, and awarded it the Best Paper Award that year. The paper was awarded a “Test of Time Award” in 2022 for its lasting impact on the research community.\nThe Berkeley Lab’s work with Zeek/Bro has continued over the years including 100G capable network monitoring using Bro in 2015; applications of Zeek/Bro to the Science DMZ and Medical Science DMZ network design patterns; the commercial spinoff of Zeek/Bro into Corelight(previously Broala) by Paxson, Robin Sommer, and LBNL Scientific Division Director / ESnet Director, Greg Bell; and Berkeley Lab and ESnet personnels’ continued roles on the Zeek Leadership Team.\nThe canonical reference for Zeek/Bro is Paxson’s 1999 ``Bro: A System for Detecting Network Intruders in Real-Time.\u0026#39;\u0026#39;\nMore Information: Vern Paxson Zeek (open source) Corelight (commercial spinoff) additional history\nMore information is available on other Berkeley Lab R\u0026amp;D projects focusing on cybersecurity in general, as well as specifically on cybersecurity for research cyberinfrastructure and high-performance computing.\n","date":938649600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":938649600,"objectID":"b94cdcb4f6815815ca96cab12fa3bef0","permalink":"https://secpriv.lbl.gov/project/network-security-monitor/","publishdate":"1999-09-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/network-security-monitor/","section":"project","summary":"Vern Paxson developed the Bro/Zeek Network Security Monitor while at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.","tags":["research cyberinfrastructure","secure systems","network"],"title":"Bro/Zeek Network Security Monitor","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://secpriv.lbl.gov/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"google-site-verification: googlea3505071e5b054e3.html","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"4fc054b4a3fcaa34f6bfab96066274c4","permalink":"https://secpriv.lbl.gov/googlea3505071e5b054e3/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/googlea3505071e5b054e3/","section":"","summary":"google-site-verification: googlea3505071e5b054e3.html","tags":null,"title":"","type":"page"}]
